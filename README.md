# Pathfinding-Visualizer
This is one of my college projects which I decided put here. We had a theme about the multimodal transportation, hyperautomation & digital connectivity to make a project.<br />
So I decided to make Pathfinding Visualizer. <br />
I was inspired by that video on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4t_-NjY_Sg&t=0s&ab_channel=Cl%C3%A9mentMihailescu <br />
I tried to make it using ASP.NET but I failed. <br />
I ended up just printing a canvas with the start point and end point.<br />
After some a while I found whis video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waEsGu--9P8&ab_channel=CodeMonkey) which step by step shows how to make Pathfinding visualizer in Unity. <br />
So followed his tutorials.<br />
Initially, I didn't want to put it as my project but after realizing how it impacted me I decided to post it anyway.
